MAZE

Simple steps on how to create a maze generator in java

Cell
---
1. Need a Cell class to hold data about an individual square on the grid
2. This will hold its position in the grid (i and j).
3. Its cell size (static and final)
4. Need to be able to draw each of its walls individually (array to hold booleans for each side, draw based on this array)
5. Needs to know whether it has been visited before
6. Needs to be able to remove one of its walls based on a _next_ cell
7. Needs to be able to get the current index in the grid arraylist (i + j * cols)
8. Needs to be able to get the current unvisited neighbours

Screen
---
1. Create a number of rows and columns you want based on a cell size
2. Make width and height fill this size
3. Make a _grid_ arraylist of cells containing rows * cols number of elements
4. fill with a new cell at each position (for loop within for loop)
5. create a stack

Maze generation
---
1. Make initial cell the current and mark it visited
- while there are unvisited cells
 - if the current cell has neighbours that are not visited
        1. go to one of those cells at random (next)
        2. push current to stack
        3. remove wall between current and next
        4. make next current and mark visited
 - else if stack is not empty
        1. pop a cell from the stack
        2. make it the current cell
